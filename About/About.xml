	<description>Breed bees to generate all kinds of resources! 

&lt;size=24&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;

- Beekeeping: find wild bees in all biomes, build beehouses to put them to work! A single beehouse won't do much, so prepare to build a few. Are you in an extreme biome? There are low-efficiency climatized beehouses available for you until you can get bees that modify allowed temperatures! 
- Bee breeding: Mix two breeds of bees in a beehouse, and use a brood chamber to multiply them, and an hybridization chamber to get new species (more than 30)!
- Honey making: Centrifuge the combs produced by the bees to get honey and wax
- Cooking and building: honey can be used as an ingredient in cooking, and wax can be used as a building material
- Mead brewing: turn honey into mead to make your colonists happy (and drunk)
- Wax lighting: candles are a quaint and cheap way to light your base
- Resource gathering: many of the bees produce combs with more things than honey and wax. Will you find the Luciferium-producing bees?
- Research: discover new exciting bee combinations
- Pollination: plan your growing zones around your beehives and increase your crop production

&lt;size=24&gt;Issues&lt;/size&gt;

Balance is always a work in progress!

&lt;size=24&gt;Plans for the future&lt;/size&gt;

More bees!
