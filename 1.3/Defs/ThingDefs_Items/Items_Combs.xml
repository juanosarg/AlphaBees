		<label>high honeycomb</label>
		<description>This is a honeycomb produced by High bees. High bees are junkies, permanently high on yayo. This makes them pretty terrible workers, but they produce a significant, constant amount of drugs, which accumulates on their combs. Honeycombs can be procesed in a Honey Extractor to get psychotropic honey, beeswax and yayo.</description>

		<description>This is a honeycomb produced by Lucifer bees. An entire breed of bees addicted to luciferium. Lucifer bees are the slowest working bees possible, what with the constant dying and suffering but they produce a significant, constant amount of luciferium, which accumulates on their combs. Honeycombs can be procesed in a Honey Extractor to get psychotropic honey, red beeswax and luciferium.</description>

		<description>This is a honeycomb produced by Culinary bees. Culinary bees like to cook. They are not very good at it, but the poor critters try to do their best. Their combs have a nutrient paste that can be processed into a very simple meal. Not appetizing, but edible. Honeycombs can be procesed in a Honey Extractor to get honey, beeswax and nutrient paste.</description>

		<description>This is a honeycomb produced by Chef bees. Chef bees REALLY do like to cook! And they are surprisingly good at it, too! They accumulate different ingredients on their combs, and those can be easily turned into a meal of decent quality. Honeycombs can be procesed in a Honey Extractor to get honey, beeswax and fine meals.</description>
