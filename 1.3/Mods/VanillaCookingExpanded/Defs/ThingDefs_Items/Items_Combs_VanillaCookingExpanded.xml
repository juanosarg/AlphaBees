		<description>This is a honeycomb produced by spicy bees, which are only happy if they are pollinating spicy plants. They gather the pollen and create capsaicin-infused honeycombs that can be extracted to get varied spices. Honeycombs can be procesed in a Honey Extractor to get honey, beeswax and spices.</description>
