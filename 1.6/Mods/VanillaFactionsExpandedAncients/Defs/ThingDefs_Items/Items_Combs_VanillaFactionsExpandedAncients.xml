		<description>This is a honeycomb produced by superhero bees. When bees need to fight a supervillain, they don't call a bee that dresses as a bat and fights petty crime at night, because that would be absurd: they call the superhero bees, who fly around at supersonic speeds dressed in teeny tiny capes and blue pyjamas. Honeycombs can be processed in a Honey Extractor to get steelwax and super-nanites.</description>
