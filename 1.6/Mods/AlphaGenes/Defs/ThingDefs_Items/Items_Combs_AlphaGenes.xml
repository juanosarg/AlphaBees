		<label>Genetweaking honeycomb</label>
		<description>This is a honeycomb produced by Genetweaking bees. The Genetweaking Bee is a bio-engineered marvel that produces strange gene-tweaking artifacts. Colonists can use these artifacts to modify their genetic makeup. Honeycombs can be processed in a Honey Extractor to get honey, beeswax and random Gene tweaking artifacts.</description>
