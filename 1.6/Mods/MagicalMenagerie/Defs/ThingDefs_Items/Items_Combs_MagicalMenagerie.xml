		<label>light magical honeycomb</label>
		<description>This is a honeycomb produced by light Magical bees, which are novice magic practicioners. They may know a couple cantrips, and a bunch of nonsensical incantations, but their greatest skill is transforming nearby Plainleather into Light Magical Leather, which is then tightly woven into their combs. Honeycombs can be processed in a Honey Extractor to get Psychotropic honey, beeswax and light magical leather.</description>
