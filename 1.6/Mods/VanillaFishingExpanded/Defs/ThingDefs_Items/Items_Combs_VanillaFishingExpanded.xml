		<description>This is a honeycomb produced by fisher bees. They love nothing more than a relaxing fishing session (read: boring). Their honeycombs get saturated with tiny pieces of fish, which is as disgusting as it sounds. Honeycombs can be procesed in a Honey Extractor to get Tasty honey, beeswax and nondescript fish.</description>
