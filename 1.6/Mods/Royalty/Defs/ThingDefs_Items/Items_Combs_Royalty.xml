		<label>Anima honeycomb</label>
		<description>This is a honeycomb produced by Anima bees. Anima bees are attuned to anima trees, and can act as powerful conduits for the tree's psychic energies. They'll provide a psychic stat bonus to colonists in the beehouse's area of effect. These honeycombs can be procesed in a Honey Extractor to get psychotropic honey and beeswax, though at very small amounts.</description>
