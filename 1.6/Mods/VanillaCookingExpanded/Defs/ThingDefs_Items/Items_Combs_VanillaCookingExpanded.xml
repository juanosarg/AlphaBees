		<description>This is a honeycomb produced by spicy bees, which are only happy if they are pollinating spicy plants. They gather the pollen and create capsaicin-infused honeycombs that can be extracted to get varied spices and condiments. Honeycombs can be procesed in a Honey Extractor to get honey, beeswax and a random condiment (except resurrector nanites).</description>
