		<label>automatic honeycomb</label>
		<description>This is a honeycomb produced by automatic bees. Automatic bees are one of the few bee breeds that are not created by hybridizing, but directly built by the colonists, since they are completely artificial. They create honeycombs stuffed with Mechanoid Components. Honeycombs can be processed in a Honey Extractor to get steelwax and mechanoid components.</description>
