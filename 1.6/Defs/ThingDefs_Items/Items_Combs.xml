Their gentle, pheromone-laden buzz calms even the most aggressive creatures. Once a day, they'll try to tame a wild animal in the map that has been designated by the player (using the "Tame" designator). This tame attempt will be done at skill level 10, requires no food and doesn't risk angering the animal. Contrary to other bees, Handler bees act map wide, outside their beehouse's area of effect. These honeycombs can be procesed in a Honey Extractor to get performance enhancing honey and beeswax, though at very small amounts.</description>

		<description>This is a honeycomb produced by Fabricated bees. Fabricated bees synthesize technology and refine it into a more advanced form. They'll need a stockpile with Components nearby and they'll slowly incorporate them into their honeycombs as Advanced Components. Honeycombs can be procesed in a Honey Extractor to get white honey, heavy beeswax and advanced components.</description>
